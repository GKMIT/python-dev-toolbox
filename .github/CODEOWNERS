# This is the CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line defines a file pattern and the GitHub usernames or teams responsible.
# The pattern is a path relative to the root of the repository.
# The last matching pattern for a path determines the code owners.
# Owners are specified as GitHub usernames (@username) or teams (@org/team).
