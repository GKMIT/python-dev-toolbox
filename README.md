# Python Boilerplate and Reference Repository

This repository serves as a collection of reusable boilerplate code, configuration examples, scripts, and snippets for various Python frameworks, libraries, third-party integrations, and infrastructure tools. The goal is to provide quick-start examples and reference patterns for common tasks and setups.

**Disclaimer:** This is a reference repository. The code snippets are intended as starting points and examples. They are not necessarily production-ready without adaptation and testing. Always review and understand the code before integrating it into your projects.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized by technology and purpose, primarily focusing on Python-related code and configurations. You'll find:

* **Framework Boilerplates & Snippets:** Common patterns and examples for popular Python web frameworks and task queues like Django, Flask, FastAPI, and Celery.
* **Third-Party Integration Examples:** Code to interact with common external services like LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini), Payment Gateways (Stripe), and SMS Services (Twilio).
* **Tooling & Infrastructure Configurations/Scripts:** Examples of Python scripts and configuration patterns for interacting with tools like Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes, and Docker.
* **Common Utilities:** Reusable Python functions, decorators, and helper modules applicable across different projects.
* **General Scripts:** Useful standalone scripts for development or operational tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GKMIT/python-dev-toolbox
   cd python-dev-toolbox
   ```

2. **Install uv**

   Install the `uv` tool using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and sync dependencies using a single lockfile. The `uv` tool is fast and efficient, and this setup allows flexibility to switch to module-level `pyproject.toml` files if needed in the future:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**

   Set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Explore the directory structure (`frameworks`, `integrations`, `tools`, etc.) to locate the technology or pattern you need.
2.  **Copy & Adapt:** Copy the relevant files or snippets into your own project. **Remember to adapt the code** to fit your specific project's requirements, naming conventions, and structure.
3.  **Run Examples:** Some directories (e.g., within `integrations/` or `frameworks/*/examples/`) may contain small, runnable examples.
      * Navigate into the example directory.
      * Check if there's a specific `requirements.txt` in that directory or the parent (e.g., `frameworks/django/requirements.txt`). Install necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
      * Follow any specific instructions provided within comments or a local `README` file in the example directory.
      * **Handle Secrets:** For integrations (APIs, databases), examples will likely use environment variables or placeholder values. **NEVER commit sensitive information** like API keys or database credentials directly into your code or a `.env` file that you commit. Use environment variables loaded securely.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome\! If you have a useful boilerplate, snippet, configuration, or script that fits the scope of this repository, please consider contributing.

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-snippet`).
3.  Add your code to the appropriate directory, following the existing structure and adding comments where necessary.
4.  Ensure your code is formatted (e.g., using Black) and linted (e.g., using Flake8 or Ruff).
5.  Write a clear commit message.
6.  Push your branch (`git push origin feature/your-snippet`).
7.  Open a Pull Request describing your contribution.

Please ensure your contributions are generic enough to be useful as a reference and do not include project-specific details or sensitive information.
